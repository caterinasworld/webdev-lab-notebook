## Reflection Document

###  01 - HTML
#### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own?
I was able to complete most of the exercises on my own with a little bit of outside help 
with the form. The form ended up being the hardest part with trying to get all the elements
to line up correctly. 

#### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section?
The exercises were surprisingly helpful with the advantage of really begining to understand
how elements work in html. I liked the table exercise specifically.

#### Was there something that could be better explained?
The form elements and how to get those to line up correctly could have been better explained.

#### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topic?
None at all, as this being the first exercise it is a figure it out kind of thing.


### 02 - a11y
#### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own?
I wasnt since there were no real directions on what to do for this exercise.

#### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section?
Not very helpful since I had already done a form in the previous weeks exercise.

#### Was there something that could be better explained?
Exactly what to do with this exercise since there were no directions for it.

#### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topic?
Would have been nice to start css here.


### 03 - CSS
#### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own?
For the most part I was! Positions was the only one that I ended up using outside help
on the internet to fin out how exactly it worked. 

#### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section?
The exercises were very helpful as they cleared up how css works for me and really allowed
me to feel more confident in how I use html and css. Html is the elements, and css adjusts the
elements.

#### Was there something that could be better explained?
Nothing at all, I thought the exercises.md file was thourghough on what needed to be done. 

#### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topic?
None at all. 


### 04 - Flexbox
#### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own?
I was not, I had a lot of issues with flexbox as it was hard to get things to line up
correctly. It took me quite a while to figure out how to get the first set of flexbox items
to line up correctly and I ended up throwing ideas at the wall to see if they stuck to 
no avail for a while. I ended up adding breaks to the html to get the flexboxes to work
as the assignment layed out, which you will see in my solutions. 

#### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section?
Not particularly helpful, it made me dislike using flexboxes of which I now chose grids over
flexboxes. 

#### Was there something that could be better explained?
How to get flexbox elements to shift to a new line, that was something that never made
sense to me and I dont see how I can do it without a break element. 

#### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topic?
How to shift flexbox elements to a new line. 


### 05 - CSS-Grid
#### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own?
This was my favorite exercise! I really enjoyed the simplicity of gird and how it 
allowed me to seemlessly move items around the grid. I was able to complete this 
on my own. 

#### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section?
I found them very helpful, so much so that I choose to use a grid rather than the flexbox
now. 

#### Was there something that could be better explained?
Nothing at all! I enjoyed this exercise. 

#### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topic?
Nothing at all. 


### 06 - Bootstrap
#### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own?
Bootstrap was a really neat exercise, which I did use the internet for help explaining
on how bootstrap works. I thought it was neat that I could get around using css in 
some places and just use the bootstrap itself. 

#### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section?
Very helpful. I really enjoyed the cards exercise since that is something that I 
generally have struggled with. 

#### Was there something that could be better explained?
Bootstrap itself, I did look up some online guides on how elements work in this. 

#### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topic?
A bootstrap form would have been a cool exercise. 


### 07 - javascript
#### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own?
I was able to complete some of them on my own, and some of them with help from the solutions
branch. 

#### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section?
I found it really helpful on revealing how JS works in the background of a web page. The 
exercises gave me a lot of aha moments on when I should be using JS. 

#### Was there something that could be better explained?
How to run a JS file on its own, without any associated html. This was something that 
wasnt explained well in the exercises.md file.

#### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topic?
None at all. I felt like the JS exercises covered a wide range of topics. 


### 08 - JQuery
#### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own?
So I initially did these solutions wrong using the same formats from 04 and 06 
of the JS exercises. That was particularly my fault for not reading the instructions
correctly. Since you said that we dont need to do this section I ended up leaving them the 
same as they are without updating anything. 

#### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section?
Reading through your solutions is helpful since its a way for me to see how ajax and
jquery actually works. While I did use jquery in the previous exercise, this
was helpful to all see.

#### Was there something that could be better explained?
What Ajax actually is, but because of ThanksGiving I understand that we didnt have
time to go through it. 

#### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weeks topic?
Nothing at all.
